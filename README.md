# Student Finance Support
This was an Assignment i did for paper IT7x11 which was developed in ASP MVC within 2 weeks.

#Assignment Brief
The objective of this project was to develop an information system to streamline work for Student Financial Advisor for a university. The Advisor provides free and confidential advice on financial matters for students. An information system is developed to provide the client a graphical user interface at the front-end and a database at the back-end. This enables the client to insert, delete, update and retrieve student information/data

#Project Scope
-	The information system provides the client with a Graphical User Interface to allow the user to enter the information of new students into the database. 
-	The system allows the user to retrieve the information of an existing student and also update their information. 
-	The information system developed must be able to incorporate the change in client requirements during the development phase. 
-	The client would initially be provided with a working model with minimum functionality. The functionality is then added incrementally to complete this project.
-	The user may be able to view the breakdown of the budget spending (by Faculty) on food vouchers, petrol vouchers, and hardship grant on a yearly, monthly, weekly and up-to-date basis.
